            "Last month I flew out to Greece to properly meet my girlfriend’s family for the first time. I’d only met them briefly during her graduation before, so this felt like a big step.",
            "The second I landed, they welcomed me with open arms and a full-on feast — they even packed takeaway dishes just for me. I was already feeling like part of the family.",
            "The next morning I met Maggie, their adorable golden Labrador, who quickly became my new best mate for the week.",
            "We chilled at Kabouri Beach, soaking up the sun and eating some insanely good seafood — those oysters were next-level. The water was crystal clear and freezing, but worth it.",
            "We also explored the Acropolis Museum, then climbed all the way to the top of the Acropolis itself. That view over Athens? Unreal. The whole trip was this amazing mix of family, food, and history.",

            "January was a wild one — three countries in three weeks: Turkey, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. I barely had time to catch my breath but wouldn’t change a thing.",
            "Started off in Istanbul on the 23rd. The city’s vibe is unreal — old-school charm mixed with modern chaos. Ate my bodyweight in Asya Tava and took a dreamy cruise down the Bosphorus.",
            "Next stop was Dhaka on the 26th — felt amazing to be back home after two years. Saw the family, reconnected with old friends, and even hit up Dhaka Makers, an Independent Arts and Crafts Festival, which just so happened to be hosted by an old mate of mine this year. So random — but so good.",
            "Then we jetted off to Bali on February 3rd. Spent the first night gaming with my brother in the hotel (brought the PS5 obviously), then hit the beach the next day.",
            "We explored Nusa Penida with a guide, took some sketchy speedboats, and finished up in Ubud. Forest swings, sky bridges, beach hotel with a pool hoop — basically living a postcard.",

            "The event itself was insane — robots, 5G demos, startup booths, the whole shebang. It was geek heaven and I loved every second.",
            "But we didn’t just work. We got to explore too — wandered around the Gothic Quarter, saw the Sagrada Família up close, and chilled under the Arc de Triomf.",
            "Evenings were for tapas, Estrella pints, and late-night convos with the dev team. Our apartment turned into a weird mix of startup hub and frat house — full-on bonding experience.",
            "I left with a full camera roll, new industry ideas, and a proper buzz about what I do. Safe to say, I’m all in on the dev life.",

            "For our 3.5 year anniversary, my partner surprised me with tickets to see Andy McKee live — and we actually got to meet him. It was surreal meeting one of my childhood heroes, the guy who singlehandedly inspired me to pick up fingerstyle guitar.",
            "June’s been a big one. Musically, Metora Cliffs is flying! We re-released *Mind Over Matter* and people are really vibing with it. Plus, we started using in-ear monitors (IEMs) and honestly… game-changer.",
            "On the personal front, my partner and I are finally moving out of our tiny flat. We found a lovely two-bed house with a garden, a proper kitchen, and even parking — grown-up stuff.",
            "She’s just landed a new job as a tester, and I got a raise too. Feels like we’re finally stepping into the next chapter.",
            "The best bit? We’re turning the second room into a music studio. Guitars on the wall, interface on the desk, endless cups of tea. Feels like we’re building the life we’ve always wanted.",
            "Software by day, music by night. That’s the dream — and now we’re living a little piece of it.",
